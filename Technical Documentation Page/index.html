            <p>pandas is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with
            "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for
            doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful
            and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language. It is already well on its way
            towards this goal.</p>

            <header><h2>Main Features</h2></header>
            <p>Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Easy handling of missing data (represented as NaN, NA, or NaT) in floating point as well as non-floating point data</li>
                <li>Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects</li>
                <li>Automatic and explicit data alignment: objects can be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply
                ignore the labels and let Series, DataFrame, etc. automatically align the data for you in computations</li>
                <li>Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating
                and transforming data</li>
                <li>Make it easy to convert ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures into DataFrame
                objects</li>
                <li>Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets</li>
                <li>Intuitive merging and joining data sets</li>
                <li>Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets</li>
                <li>Hierarchical labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per tick)</li>
                <li>Robust IO tools for loading data from flat files (CSV and delimited), Excel files, databases, and saving/loading data
                from the ultrafast HDF5 format</li>
                <li>Time series-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, date
                shifting and lagging</li>

            </ul>

            <p>The source code is currently hosted on GitHub at: <a href="https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas">https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas</a></p>
            <p>Binary installers for the latest released version are available at the Python Package Index (PyPI) and on Conda.</p>
            <code># conda
                conda install pandas
            </code>                
            <p></p>
            <code># or PyPI 
                pip install pandas

            <header><h2>Dependencies</h2></header>
            <ul>
                <li>NumPy - Adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays, matrices and high-level mathematical functions to operate on
                these arrays</li>
                <li>python-dateutil - Provides powerful extensions to the standard datetime module</li>
                <li>pytz - Brings the Olson tz database into Python which allows accurate and cross platform timezone calculations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>See the <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html#dependencies">full installation instructions</a> for minimum supported versions of required, recommended and optional
            dependencies.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Installation_from_sources">
            <header><h2>Installation from sources</h2></header>
            <p>To install pandas from source you need Cython in addition to the normal dependencies above. Cython can be installed from
            PyPI:</p>
            <code>pip install cython</code>
            <p>In the pandas directory (same one where you found this file after cloning the git repo), execute:</p>
            <code>python setup.py install</code>
            <p>or for installing in development mode:</p>
            <code>python -m pip install -e . --no-build-isolation --no-use-pep517</code>
            <p>If you have make, you can also use make develop to run the same command.</p>
            <p>or alternatively</p>
            <code>python setup.py develop</code>
            <p>See the full instructions for <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html#installing-from-source">installing from source</a> .</p>

            <p>All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome.</p>
            
            <p>A detailed overview on how to contribute can be found in the <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/development/contributing.html">contributing guide</a>. 
            There is also an <a href="https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md">overview</a>on GitHub.</p>
            
            <p>If you are simply looking to start working with the pandas codebase, navigate to the GitHub "issues" tab and start
            looking through interesting issues. There are a number of issues listed under Docs and good first issue where you could
            start out.</p>
            
            <p>You can also triage issues which may include reproducing bug reports, or asking for vital information such as version
            numbers or reproduction instructions. If you would like to start triaging issues, one easy way to get started is to
            subscribe to pandas on CodeTriage.</p>
            
            <p>Or maybe through using pandas you have an idea of your own or are looking for something in the documentation and
            thinking ‘this can be improved’...you can do something about it!</p>
            
            <p>Feel free to ask questions on the mailing list or on Gitter.</p>
